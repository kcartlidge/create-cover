# Create Cover

Generate a 900 x 1350 pixel SVG cover.
Supports a small selection of themes using a standard (and auto-arranging) layout.

*(Examples are at the bottom.)*

## To generate a cover

Currently all details are hard-coded, though the logic is in there to support the
required options once argument parsing has been added.

## To convert to a PNG

- Open the SVG file in a Chromium browser (eg Brave)
- Right-click on it and choose 'Inspect'
- In the 'Elements' right-click on the SVG node
- Choose 'Capture node screenshot' to save it as a PNG
